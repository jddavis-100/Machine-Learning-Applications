#Data-Science, Statistics and Machine Learning Applications

Here you will find some use cases for common Data Science (statistics and machine learning) applications. These cases are divided into sections.  I made great care not to rely on just one programming language _as it is the technique, not the scripting language_ that is important.  If you are new to scripting, I recommend learning to create 'pseudo-code'.  This is a list of sequential commands which you will then change into the syntax of the particular scripting language you intend to use.  That being said, for some problems there are advantages to particular scripting languages. The examples I have provided in this wiki mostly rely upon R, Python, Clojure and Java, with the intent to also include some algorithms which can be easily run on Spark Clusters.  This site will be filled with more code as time progresses, so feel free to check back every so often.  Enjoy!
