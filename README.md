#Machine-Learning-Applications

Here you will find some use cases for common Data Science (statistics and machine learning) applications. These cases are divided into sections.  I made great care not to rely on just one programming language _as it is the technique, not the scripting language_ that is important.  If you are new to scripting, I recommend learning to create 'pseudo-code'.  This is a list of sequential commands which you will then change into the syntax of the particular scripting language you intend to use. The examples I have provided in this wiki mostly rely upon R, Python and Java, but the intent is to include some Scala-based algorithms which can be easily run on Spark Clusters.  This site will be filled with more code as time progresses, so feel free to check back every so often.  Enjoy!
